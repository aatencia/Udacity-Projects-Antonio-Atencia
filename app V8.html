        <ul>
          <li><b>How the Web Works </b>- The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents. The links between these pages called hyperlinks. The major pieces are you, your computer, the Internet, and servers.Your browser makes requests via the Internet to servers. These requests are using a protocol called http and the servers respond with files that your browser displays.</li>
          <li><b>HTML</b>- HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the basis for almost every webpage. Even though there can be, documents, images, videos, and you know, all sorts of things online. HTML is what glues everything together</li>
          <li><b>Tags and Elements </b>- HTML markup is made up of tags. The way a tag is structured is, you've got, a less than symbol, the tag name, a greater than symbol, the tag contents, which can actually be other tags or it could just be text, another less than symbol, a slash, the name, and a greater than symbol. An element is an o.ening tag, contents, closing tag</li>
          <li><b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>- Inline tags are just text whereas block tags create a box around the text that can actually have height and width. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li Class="descrip2"><b>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Document Object Model DOM</b>- The browser turns HTML tags into elements that form a tree. It knows how to do that because of the document object model, or DOM, which is a standard convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML</li>
          <li><b>Boxes Everywhere</b>- On a website, something may look like a circle or a triangle or something a little more irregular, but, in fact it's still just a box, it just looks like a circle. Thinking of the things in terms of boxes makes your life as a front-end web developer a lot easier. We define boxes with div tags.</li>
          <li><b>Adding Style to Boxes </b>-The best way to do this is to give each element a class attribute. You can think of these class attributes as labels on boxes. You need to somehow mark the boxes so that you can easily apply style later </li>
          <li><b>Text Editors </b>-When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li Class="descrip3"><b>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>CSS</b>-To define the style, you have to use another language, CSS or Cascading Style Sheets. CSS allows you to use a specific syntax and rules to change how elements look on the page, the size of the font, the color, background, borders, position, and on and on. Changing the visual properties of an element only changes how the element is displayed, not what kind of element it is.</li>
          <li><b>Linking HTML to CSS</b>- To tie structure and style together, the HTML document can provide the browser with information on what style to use and where to get it. First, you need to add a single line at the start of the HTML file.</li>
          <li><b>What do Cascading and Sheets Mean?</b>-First, you can have several CSS files or sheets that will be referenced in HTML and all of them will be used to find out the final and visible style for your page. With CSS the most specific rule is applied to every element. This concept of most specific rule applied is what the word cascading means.</li>
          <li><b>Avoiding Repetition</b> -Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.Avoiding Errors: When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.Consistency: In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson div the same class and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.</li>
